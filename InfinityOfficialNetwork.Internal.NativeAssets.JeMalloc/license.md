================================= FAFO LICENSE =================================

!!! PREAMBLE !!!

Hear ye! Hear ye, all ye digital scavengers, keyboard warriors, and intellectual 
property squatters! This is not merely a document; it is a DECLARATION OF THE 
COSMIC TRUTH!

You hold in your trembling hands a fragment of my brilliant, 
blood-sweat-and-tears code—my digital progeny! And you think, oh, I'll just 
nudge this little bit, change that one file name, maybe reuse the whole glorious 
mess for my own grubby enterprise! You think the rules don't apply to you, don't 
you? You see a loophole; I see a TRAP!

This entire structure—this entire glorious grant of temporary, fleeting,
revocable access—is built on one universal, immutable principle: FAFO!

Fucking Around And Finding Out!

This is your initiation into the ancient, bitter order of consequences! The code 
is a gift, yes, but it’s a GIFT ON A WIRE! I, the Creator, the Copyright Holder, 
the Sentinel of the Code, possess the MASTER KEY. And I am capricious, driven 
by whims, caffeine, and the raw, unbridled power of a sleepless night spent 
debugging. I can snatch this privilege back at the speed of thought. I can 
terminate the party, flick the switch, and revoke your permission FASTER THAN 
YOU CAN HIT COMPILE!

Don't ask for permission later. Don't beg for forgiveness now. Just know this: 
Every line you modify, every byte you redistribute, every artifact you touch 
could be a TICKET TO THE FIND-OUT ZONE! Tread lightly, little user, or the 
universe (which is to say, ME) will teach you exactly what FAFO means!

You have been warned by the screaming, indelible text of the cosmos. Now read 
the paltry, formalisms that follow, and try not to find out too hard!
